Using machine learning for crop yield prediction cause problem like 
    - improvident nonlinear mapping between raw data crop yield values. 

But deep learning is one of the solution, in which we use - 
    - DBN (deep belief network) , FNN (fuzzy neural network system) 
        - DBN = probability + stats + neural network 
        - DBN itself can solve nonlinearity problem , but not so good for model accuracy, robustness, learning speed due to 'Gradient diffusion'. 
    - So to solve nonlinearity and Gradient diffusion we use DBN with FNN . 

firstly we performs efficient pre-training technique by DBN which results in a enhanced model and a feature vector generation. 
this feature vector then fed to FNN for processing. 

in this we can get an accuracy at upto 92% .

- Agronomy :- 
    - Food demand predicted to arise from 60% to 95% till 2050. 
    - expanding crop production using low field area is critical to achieve. 
    - yet we do not have benchmark dataset for agrarian research because it fluctuate with cliamatic condition, kind of crops, irigation techniques etc. 
    - deep learning has capability of -> efficient dimension reduction, analyzing nonlinearity parameters from given dataset
